#### Version 0.1
the app is now able to show a funny pun, a list of all sensor available to the current device, and a button that switches Activity and layout.
upon clicking the button, the SensorActivity is launched, which retrieves information trough the pressure sensor on the device, and prints the information retrieved accordingly.
